{{< figure src="https://secure.hosting.vt.edu/www.arc.vt.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/bevan_ab_1_resize.jpg" alt="amyloid" width="196pt" class="figure img-responsive align-left" >}}

A deep learning model in [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) to
analyze important features and predict secondary structures of
[amyloid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid) proteins. Please look
at some of my past
[publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rSMYeYEAAAAJ&hl=en)
for additional details of this work.
