There are two types of data visualizations: _exploratory_ and _explanatory_.
Explanatory analysis is what happens when you have something specific you want 
to show an audience. The aim of **explanatory** visualizations is to tell 
stories - theyâ€™re carefully constructed to surface key findings.

Exploratory analysis, on the other hand, is what you do to get familiar with 
the data. You may start out with a hypothesis or question, or you may just 
really be delving into the data to determine what might be interesting about 
it. **Exploratory** visualizations, "create an interface into a dataset or 
subject matter... they facilitate the user exploring the data, letting them 
unearth their own insights: findings they consider relevant or interesting."

In a previous series of posts on
[exploratory data analysis (EDA)][EDA] - [EDA 1], [EDA 2], [EDA 3] and
[EDA 4], we have covered static plotting in python using major libraries
like [matplotlib], [seaborn], [plotnine], and [pandas]. `plotnine` is an implementation of a grammar of graphics in Python, based on the [ggplot2] library in R. The grammar allows users to compose plots by explicitly mapping data to the visual objects that make up the plot.

In this article, we will focus on EDA using interactive plots. More often than not, exploratory visualizations are easier when they are interactive!
