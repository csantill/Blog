Usually in a conventional neural network, one tries to predict a target vector
$y$ from input vectors $x$. In an autoencoder network, one tries to predict $x$
from $x$. It is trivial to learn a mapping from $x$ to $x$ if the network has no
constraints, but if the network is constrained the learning process becomes more
interesting.
