There are two types of data visualizations: _exploratory_ and _explanatory_.
Explanatory analysis is what happens when you have something specific you want 
to show an audience. The aim of **explanatory** visualizations is to tell 
stories - they’re carefully constructed to surface key findings.
Exploratory analysis, on the other hand, is what you do to get familiar with 
the data. You may start out with a hypothesis or question, or you may just 
really be delving into the data to determine what might be interesting about 
it. **Exploratory** visualizations “create an interface into a dataset or 
subject matter... they facilitate the user exploring the data, letting them 
unearth their own insights: findings they consider relevant or interesting.”
