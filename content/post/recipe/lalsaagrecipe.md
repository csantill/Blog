I have started eating a lot of greens these days. As a kid, I always
loved a vegetable made by my mom, which was made of red leaves, called
"*Laal Saag*" in Hindi. I could never find what exactly was the
English/American name for those leaves.

Recently, at one of the Korean grocery stores, I came across red
Amaranth leaves. Those looked strikingly similar to the red leaves that
I used to have back home in India.

So, here is my super fast and healthy recipe for these red leaves. It
took me just 10 minutes ( 5 Minutes Preparation + 5 Minutes Cooking).

-   1 tbsp Mustard Black Seeds
-   1 tbsp Cumin Seeds
-   2 tbsp Olive Oil
-   Salt to taste

Preparation
===========

1.  Wash the leaves thoroughly in running water and chop them (about 1
    inch cuts).
2.  Heat a deep pan on Medium for about 1 minute and then pour olive oil into it.
3.  After about 30 seconds, Add mustard seeds and cumin seeds after
    another 30 seconds.
4.  Once Seeds start to pop, add cut leaves into the pan.
5.  Add salt, close the lid and keep stirring occasionally.
6.  Once the leaves have lost water, add all the spices and keep frying
    until things are dry (about 2-3 minutes).

You can serve this with any Indian bread, or with rice and lentils
(*Daal*).
