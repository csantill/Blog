    A deep learning model in `Tensorflow <https://www.tensorflow.org/>`_ to
    analyze important features and predict secondary structures of
    `amyloid <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid>`_ proteins.
    Please look at some of my past
    `publications <https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rSMYeYEAAAAJ&hl=en>`_ for
    additional details of this work.

.. admonition:: **Flac To mp3 Converter**

    A simple python script to maintain flac and mp3 files in sync, including
    tags, and album art. This script can be used as a cron job to keep files in sync.
    The code `repository <https://github.com/sadanand-singh/flac2mp3>`_ is
    available on Github.

.. admonition:: **Kaggle Competitions**

    Python code and notebooks for different `Kaggle <https://www.kaggle.com/>`_ competitions that I have
    participated. The repositories (names starting with *kaggle*) can be found on
    my `Github <https://github.com/sadanand-singh/>`_ account page.
