The data from the project corresponds to a survey from http://reddit.com . You can load the data through the following command.We will first look at the different attributes of this data using the str() method. reddit <- read.csv ( \"https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/reddit.csv\" ) str (( reddit )) ## 'data.frame': 32754 obs. of 14 variables: ## $ id : int 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... ## $ gender : int 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 ... ## $ age.range : Factor w/ 7 levels \"18-24\",\"25-34\",..: 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 1 3 2 ... ## $ marital.status : Factor w/ 6 levels \"Engaged\",\"Forever Alone\",..: NA NA NA NA NA 4 3 4 4 3 ... ## $ employment.status: Factor w/ 6 levels \"Employed full time\",..: 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 4 1 2 ... ## $ military.service : Factor w/ 2 levels \"No\",\"Yes\": NA NA NA NA NA 1 1 1 1 1 ... ## $ children : Factor w/ 2 levels \"No\",\"Yes\": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... ## $ education : Factor w/ 7 levels \"Associate degree\",..: 2 2 5 2 2 2 5 2 2 5 ... ## $ country : Factor w/ 439 levels \" Canada\",\" Canada eh\",..: 394 394 394 394 394 394 125 394 394 125 ... ## $ state : Factor w/ 53 levels \"\",\"Alabama\",\"Alaska\",..: 33 33 48 33 6 33 1 6 33 1 ... ## $ income.range : Factor w/ 8 levels \"$100,000 - $149,999\",..: 2 2 8 2 7 2 NA 7 2 7 ... ## $ fav.reddit : Factor w/ 1834 levels \"\",\"___\",\"-\",\"?\",..: 720 691 1511 1528 188 691 1318 571 1629 1 ... ## $ dog.cat : Factor w/ 3 levels \"I like cats.\",..: NA NA NA NA NA 2 2 2 1 1 ... ## $ cheese : Factor w/ 11 levels \"American\",\"Brie\",..: NA NA NA NA NA 3 3 1 10 7 ... This gives us the details about different columns of data in this data set. More closely, we find two types of variables being used in this dataset: int and Factor . \"id\"\" and \"gender\" are integers, while rest of the variables are of type Factor . These Factor type variables have multiple levels. We can also look at a brief summary of the data set using the summary() method. summary ( reddit ) ## id gender age.range ## Min. : 1 Min. :0.0000 18-24 :15802 ## 1st Qu.: 8189 1st Qu.:0.0000 25-34 :11575 ## Median :16380 Median :0.0000 Under 18: 2330 ## Mean :16379 Mean :0.1885 35-44 : 2257 ## 3rd Qu.:24568 3rd Qu.:0.0000 45-54 : 502 ## Max. :32756 Max. :1.0000 (Other) : 200 ## NA's :201 NA's : 88 ## marital.status ## Engaged : 1109 ## Forever Alone : 5850 ## In a relationship : 9828 ## Married/civil union/domestic partnership: 5490 ## Single :10428 ## Widowed : 44 ## NA's : 5 ## employment.status military.service ## Employed full time :14814 No :30526 ## Freelance : 1948 Yes : 2223 ## Not employed and not looking for work: 682 NA's: 5 ## Not employed, but looking for work : 2087 ## Retired : 85 ## Student :12987 ## NA's : 151 ## children education ## No :27488 Bachelor's degree :11046 ## Yes : 5047 Some college : 9600 ## NA's: 219 Graduate or professional degree : 4722 ## High school graduate or equivalent: 3272 ## Some high school : 1924 ## (Other) : 2046 ## NA's : 144 ## country state income.range ## United States :20967 :11908 Under $20,000 :7892 ## Canada : 2888 California: 3401 $50,000 - $69,999 :4133 ## United Kingdom: 1782 Texas : 1541 $70,000 - $99,999 :4101 ## Australia : 1051 New York : 1418 $100,000 - $149,999:3522 ## Germany : 407 Illinois : 976 $20,000 - $29,999 :3206 ## (Other) : 5482 Washington: 910 (Other) :8285 ## NA's : 177 (Other) :12600 NA's :1615 ## fav.reddit dog.cat cheese ## : 4335 I like cats. :11156 Other :6563 ## askreddit : 2123 I like dogs. :17151 Cheddar :6102 ## fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu: 1746 I like turtles.: 4442 Brie :3742 ## pics : 1651 NA's : 5 Provolone:3456 ## trees : 1311 Swiss :3214 ## (Other) :21562 (Other) :9672 ## NA's : 26 NA's : 5 The summary() method provides a more detailed analysis of the data, albeit only numerically. We can see that the int types are reported with important statistics like min,max and 4 Quartiles. The Factor types are listed with frequency of different levels. levels ( reddit $ age.range ) ## [1] \"18-24\" \"25-34\" \"35-44\" \"45-54\" \"55-64\" ## [6] \"65 or Above\" \"Under 18\" Let us look at the age.range variable in more detail. We can look at the different levels of this variables using the levels() method. This shows there are 7 possible values of this variable and some where no data is available ( NA ). A more pictorial view of this can be seen using a histogram plot of this. Similarly, we can also plot a distribution of income.range. One problem with the above plots is that the different levels are not ordered. This can be fixed using ordered Factors, instead of regular factor type variables. Additionally, We need to use a more reasonable x-label for plotting income.range. reddit $ age.range <- factor ( reddit $ age.range , levels = c ( \"Under 18\" , \"18-24\" , \"25-34\" , \"35-44\" , \"45-54\" , \"55-64\" , \"65 or Above\" ), ordered = TRUE ) levels ( reddit $ income.range ) ## [1] \"$100,000 - $149,999\" \"$150,000 or more\" \"$20,000 - $29,999\" ## [4] \"$30,000 - $39,999\"

Due to its focus on readability, wide-spread popularity and existence of a plethora of libraries (also called modules), it is one of the most preferred programming languages for scientists and engineers. In this series of python tutorials, I will provide a set of lectures on various basic topics of python. The prime target audience for this series are scientist in non-programming fields like microbiology, genetics, psychology etc. who have some to none programming experience. Here is a brief list of topics I will cover per week. I will also post exercises at the end of each session, along with the expected outputs. You should plan to complete these exercises within 5-6 days, before the new tutorial is posted. You will be judging your exercises on your own. The goal should be to match your program's output to the expected output. Week 1 : Working with Python on Windows, Concept of Variables & Math Operations, Displaying Outputs Week 2 : User Inputs, Modules, Comments and Basics of Strings Week 3 : More on Strings, Lists and Other Containers Week 4 : Looping/iterating, if/else Conditions Week 5 : Advanced String Operations Week 6 : Regular Expressions and Strings Week 7 : Reading and Writing Files Week 8 : Functions and Writing Scripts Week 9 : Interacting with Operating System Week 10 : Handling and Plotting Data in Python Week 11 : Basic Statistics in Python using Pandas Week 12 : Introduction to Biopython Week 1. Introduction to Python To start working with any programming language, first thing you need is a working installation of that language. Today, we will go through installation of python on Windows machines. To keep things simple, We will be running our simple programs in google chrome browser, without any need of an installation. For later exercises, from Week 7 onwards, I would highly recommend getting access to a Linux/Mac machine. However, I will also provide doing the same things on Windows machines and Google Chrome as well. In this week's session, I will be assuming you will be using online python in google chrome. To follow these tutorials, please run any code and observe output that you see in code blocks. Installing Python Go to the following website to get access to python: http://repl.it/languages/python3 You should get a window like this: You can work with this system in two ways: A. Write your code interactively (one command at a time) on the dark screen on the left. Pressing ENTER will show you the output of that particular command. Lets' try our first program: In [1]: print ( \"My Name is so-and-so\" ) My Name is so-and-so The above program will simply output whatever was put under \"quotes\". We will learn more about the print() method (what is a method/function in python?) towards the end of this session. Variables A variable is a symbol or name that stands for a value. For example, in the expression x = 23 x is a name/symbol whose value is numerical and equal to 23. if we write something like this: y = x+12-5, then y is a new variable whose value should be equal to 23+12-5. Let's try these in a program In [2]: x = 23 print ( \"x = \" , x ) x = 23 In [3]: y = x + 12 - 5 print ( \"y =\" , y ) y = 30 In [4]: print ( 23 + 12 - 5 ) 30 We ran 3 commands. First we created a variable ‘x' with a value of 23. We verified it value by using a print() method! Second, we created another variable called ‘y' whose values is equal to mathematical operation of ‘x+12-5'. If you remember basic algebra, this is exactly that. Finally, we confirmed that value of ‘y' is exactly equal to 23+12-5. Hopefully, you got a feel of variables. Variables are not limited to just numbers though. We can also store text. For example: In [5]: name = \"Sadanand Singh\" print ( \"My Name is:\" , name ) My Name is: Sadanand Singh Here, we saved my name Sadanand Singh in a variable called \"name\". Concept of variable is very fundamental to any programming language. You can think of them as tokens that store some value. Lets consider this example to understand variable in more detail. You are doing your taxes, all of your calculations depend on your net income. If you do all your calculation in terms of actual value of net income, every time you write the number, your chances of making a mistake increases. Furthermore, suppose, you want to update the income due to some mistake in the beginning, now you have update every place where you used your income. Lets consider a second case where you declare a variable called \"income\", and store income = 30000. Now, any time you do any calculation with income, you will be using the variable \"income\". In this framework, because you have to type your income just once, chances of making mistakes are least and changing it needs just one change! Math Operations Now that we know how to declare and use variables, we will look at first what all we can do with numbers in python. Using simple math operations are extremely easy in Python. Here are all the basic math operations that one can do in Python. Syntax Math Operation Name a+b a + b Addition a-b a - b Subtraction a*b a x b Multiplication a/b $a \\div b$ Division a**b $a&#94;b$ Power/Exponent abs(a) Absolute Value -a $-1 \\times a$ Negation a//b quotient of $a \\div b$ Quotient a%b Remainder of $a \\div b$ Remainder Here are some example operation. Please repeat these and observe the use of parenthesis in using the BODMAS principle. In [6]: 3 + 5 Out[6]: 8 In [7]: 2 * 3 + 3.34 + 4 - 45.67 Out[7]: -32.33 In [8]: 12.7 - 10 * 23.5 / 0.5 Out[8]: -457.3 In [9]: 12 - ( 11 + 34 ) / 2 Out[9]: -10.5 In [10]: a , b = 5 , 6 Above is a special case of assigning multiple variables together. In the above example we stored a=5 and b=6. Lets confirm these: In [11]: print ( \"a = \" , a ) print ( \"b = \" , b ) a = 5 b = 6 In [12]: c = a ** b print ( \" a raised to the power b is:\" , c ) a raised to the power b is: 15625 In [13]: b = - b In [14]: print ( \"b = \" , b ) b = -6 Can you guess what we did here? First we use negation operation to get \"-b\" i.e. -6. Then, we we redefined b to be equal to -6! Let consider the following example: a = a-b-3. What do you expect the value to be? Now lets check if you are correct: In [15]: a = a - b - 3 print ( \"new value of a is: \" , a ) new value of a is: 8 What do you expect if we do b = -b again? In [16]: b = - b print ( \"New Value of b is:\" , b ) New Value of b is: 6 In [17]: a // b Out[17]: 1 In [18]: a % b Out[18]: 2 In [19]: b **- 2 Out[19]: 0.027777777777777776 You can perform many other advanced math operations using the \"math module\". To use them, first you will need to import the math module in your code like this: In [20]: import math Then, you use operations like the following: In [21]: c = math . sqrt ( 25 ) print ( c ) c = math . log ( 10 ) print ( c ) c = math . log10 ( 10 ) print ( c ) c = math . cos ( math . pi ) print ( c ) 5.0 2.302585092994046 1.0 -1.0 You can all other available mathematical operation in this module on the python website . print() Function in Python Primary way to see and print information on your screen in python is using a method/fuction called \"print()\". We will learn more about functions in python later. For today, you can think of functions as a program that \"does something\". For example, the function print(), does the job of printing things on screen. Notice the use of () in functions. () separates a function from a variable. For example, \"foo\" is a variable, whereas \"foo()\" is a function, called sometimes called as method. Functions also have a concept of arguments. Arguments can be thought as inputs to functions. For example, we have function that adds 2 numbers, then this function will need 2 arguments, the two numbers that we want to add. We can denote this function as, addition(a,b). Similarly, functions also have a concept of return values. Return value can be thought as the output of that function. For example, in the above example of addition(a,b) function, sum of two numbers will be the \"return value\" of the function. We can write this as, c = addition(a,b). Here, a and b are arguments to function addition() and c is the return value of this function. A function can have any number of arguments, zero to any number; where it can have either zero or 1 return values. Now, coming back to the print() method, that we have been using throughout this tutorial. print() method can take any number of arguments separated by commas. All it does is to \"print\" those on your screen. Lets look at some examples: In [22]: print ( 3 , 4 ) print ( \"My Name is Sadanand Singh\" ) print ( \"My Name is \" , \"Sadanand Singh\" , \"and My age is: \" , 29 ) 3 4 My Name is Sadanand Singh My Name is Sadanand Singh and My age is: 29 Now, lets try something fun. In [23]: print ( \"My Name is\" , \"Sadanand\" , sep = \"***\" ) My Name is***Sadanand In [24]: print ( \"My Name is\" , \"Sadanand\" , \"Singh\" , \"My Age is\" , \"12\" , \"\" , sep = \"***\" ) My Name is***Sadanand***Singh***My Age is***12*** Can you explain what is happening here! Excercise We will all things we have learned today using the exercise below. We will follow the tax preparation example: Create a variable to store \"income\" Create another variable called \"taxRate\" which is equal to 1/100000th of \"income\". Net federal tax will be equal to 1.5 times income times taxRate Net state tax will be equal to square root on federal tax Net tax will be federal tax + state tax Total final tax will be Net tax + log to the base of 2 of Net Tax Print following values clearly using print(): income, taxRate, Federal Tax, State Tax, Net Tax and Final Tax. First run with an income of 60000 Repeat with an income of 134675 Your output should look like the following in two cases. Case 1: income = 60000 Total Income is: 60000 Tax Rate is: 0.059999999999999998 Total Federal Tax is: 1800.0 Total State Tax is: 42.426406871192853 Net Tax is: 1842.4264068711927 Total Tax is: 1853.2737981499038 Case 2: income = 134675 Total Income is: 134675 Tax Rate is: 0.13467499999999999 Total Federal Tax is: 9068.6778125000001 Total State Tax is: 95.229605756298284 Net Tax is: 9163.9074182562981 Total Tax is: 9177.0691654243201 Great!

Ingredients 8-10 organic carrots (for a more authentic taste). Condensed milk (medium size) or 1-2 cup Ricotta cheese 1-2 cup whole Milk. Dried nuts (Chopped Almonds, Cashews, Golden raisins and Dates) Sugar/Fresh Mango puree as per taste. 3-4 Tablespoon unsalted butter 3-4 whole cardamom or 1/2 teaspoon cardamom powder Preparation Wash and Peel the carrots and grate them. Heat a non-stick pan on medium flame and add 3-4 tablespoon of butter. When the butter melts, add the grated carrots and start frying. Stir the carrots till all the water from the carrots is lost. Add Ricotta cheese with 1-2 cup whole milk or 1 can of Condensed milk and let the carrots cook for 5-7 minutes on low flame. Continuously stir the carrots so as not to burn them. When 3/4th of the milk is dried, add chopped nuts and Sugar. Turn off the flame after 3-4 minutes, after all the milk is dried. Let the halwa cool down. Garnish it with nuts and dried milk.

While going through some materials on algorithms, I have come across an interesting discussion -enhancements in hardware (cpu) vis-a-vis algorithms. One side of the coin is the hardware - the speed of computers.The famous Moore's law states that: The complexity for minimum component costs has increased at a rate of roughly a factor of two per year . Certainly over the short term this rate can be expected to continue, if not to increase. Over the longer term, the rate of increase is a bit more uncertain, although there is no reason to believe it will not remain nearly constant for at least 10 years. — G. Moore, 1965 In simple words, Moore's law is the observation that, over the history of computing hardware, the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit has doubled approximately every two years. More precisely, the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit has increased by a factor of 1.6 every two years. More recently, keeping up with this has been challenging. In the context of this discussion, the inherent assumption is that number of transistors is directly proportional to the speed of computers. Now, looking at the other side of the coin - speed of algorithms. According to Excerpt from Report to the President and Congress: Designing a Digital Future, December 2010 (page 97) : Everyone knows Moore's Law – a prediction made in 1965 by Intel co-­founder Gordon Moore that the density of transistors in integrated circuits would continue to double every 1 to 2 years…. in many areas, performance gains due to improvements in algorithms have vastly exceeded even the dramatic performance gains due to increased processor speed. The gain in computing speed due to algorithms have been simply phenomenal, unprecedented, to say the least! Being actively involved with realization of Moore's law ( guess where I work! ), I have been naturally attracted in the study and design of algorithms. To get a more practical perspective on this, lets look at the problem of finding large Fibonacci numbers . These numbers have been used in wide areas ranging from arts to economics to biology to computer science to the game of poker! The simple definition of these numbers are: $$F_{n} = \\begin{cases} F_{n-2} + F_{n-1} & \\text{if } n > 1 \\\\ 1 & \\text{if } n = 1 \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } n = 0 \\end{cases}$$ So, first few Fibonacci numbers are: \\(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144 \\ldots\\) These numbers grow almost as fast as powers of 2: for example, \\(F_{30}\\) is over a million, and \\(F_{100}\\) is 21 digits long! In general, \\(F_n \\approx 2&#94;{0.694n}\\) Clearly, we need a computing device to calculate say \\(F_{200}\\) . The most basic algorithm, that comes to mind is a recursive scheme that taps directly into the above definition of Fibonacci series. def fibRecursive ( n ): if n == 0 : return 0 if n == 1 : return 1 return fibRecursive ( n - 2 ) + fibRecursive ( n - 1 ) If you analyze this scheme, this is in fact an exponential algorithm, i.e. fibRecursive( n ) is proportional to \\(2&#94;{0.694n} \\approx (1.6)&#94;n\\) , so it takes 1.6 times longer to compute \\(F_{n+1}\\) than \\(F_n\\) . This is interesting. Recall, under Moore's law, computers get roughly 1.6 times faster every 2 years. So if we can reasonably compute \\(F_{100}\\) with this year's technology, then only after 2 years we will manage to get \\(F_{101}\\) ! Only one more Fibonacci number every 2 years! Luckily, algorithms have grown at a much faster pace. Let's consider improvements w.r.t to this current problem of finding \\(n&#94;{th}\\) Fibonacci number, \\(F_n\\) . First problem we should realize in the above recursive scheme is that we are recalculating lower \\(F_n\\) at each recursion level. Lets solve this issue by storing each calculation and avoiding any re-calculation! def fibN2 ( n ): a = 0 b = 1 if n == 0 : return 0 for i in range ( 1 , n + 1 ): c = a + b a = b b = c return b On first glance this looks like an \\(\\mathcal{O}(n)\\) scheme, as we consider each addition as one operation. However, we should realize that as \\(n\\) increases, addition can not be assumed as a single operation, rather every step of addition is an \\(\\mathcal{O}(n)\\) operation, recall first grade Math for adding numbers digit by digit!! Hence, this algorithm is an \\(\\mathcal{O}(n&#94;2)\\) scheme. Can we do better? You bet, we can! Lets consider the following scheme: $$\\begin{pmatrix} 1&1 \\\\ 1&0 \\end{pmatrix}&#94;n = \\begin{pmatrix} F_{n+1}&F_n \\\\ F_n&F_{n-1} \\end{pmatrix}$$ We can use a recursive scheme to calculate this matrix power using a divide and conquer scheme in \\(\\mathcal{O}(\\log{}n)\\) time. def mul ( A , B ): a , b , c = A d , e , f = B return a * d + b * e , a * e + b * f , b * e + c * f def pow ( A , n ): if n == 1 : return A if n & 1 == 0 : return pow ( mul ( A , A ), n // 2 ) else : return mul ( A , pow ( mul ( A , A ), ( n - 1 ) // 2 )) def fibLogN ( n ): if n < 2 : return n return pow (( 1 , 1 , 0 ), n - 1 )[ 0 ] Lets think a bit harder about this. Is it really an \\(\\mathcal{O}(\\log{}n)\\) scheme? It involves multiplication of numbers, the method mul(A, B). What happens when \\(n\\) is very large? Sure, this will blow up, as typical multiplication would be an \\(\\mathcal{O}(n&#94;2)\\) operation. So, in fact, our new scheme is \\(\\mathcal{O}(n&#94;2 \\log{}n)\\) ! Luckily, we can solve even large multiplications in \\(\\mathcal{O}(n&#94;{log_2{3}} \\approx n&#94;{1.585})\\) , using Karatsuba multiplication , which is again a divide and conquer scheme. Here is one simple implementation (Same as the above scheme, but with the following mul(A,B) method): _CUTOFF = 1536 def mul ( A , B ): a , b , c = A d , e , f = B return multiply ( a , d ) + multiply ( b , e ), multiply ( a , e ) + multiply ( b , f ), multiply ( b , e ) + multiply ( c , f ) def multiply ( x , y ): if x . bit_length () <= _CUTOFF or y . bit_length () <= _CUTOFF : return x * y else : n = max ( x . bit_length (), y . bit_length ()) half = ( n + 32 ) // 64 * 32 mask = ( 1 << half ) - 1 xlow = x & mask ylow = y & mask xhigh = x >> half yhigh = y >> half a = multiply ( xhigh , yhigh ) b = multiply ( xlow + xhigh , ylow + yhigh ) c = multiply ( xlow , ylow ) d = b - a - c return ((( a << half ) + d ) << half ) + c So, this final scheme is in \\(\\mathcal{O}(n&#94;{1.585}\\log{}n)\\) time. Here is one final way of solving this problem in the same \\(\\mathcal{O}(n&#94;{1.585}\\log{}n)\\) time, but using a somewhat simpler scheme! If we know \\(F_K\\) and \\(F_{K+1}\\) , then we can find, $$F_{2K} = F_K \\left [ 2F_{K+1}-F_K \\right ]$$ $$F_{2K+1} = {F_{K+1}}&#94;2+{F_K}&#94;2$$ We can implement this using the Karatsuba multiplication as follows: def fibFast ( n ): if n <= 2 : return 1 k = n // 2 a = fibFast ( k + 1 ) b = fibFast ( k ) if n % 2 == 1 : return multiply ( a , a ) + multiply ( b , b ) else : return multiply ( b ,( 2 * a - b )) That's it for today. We saw how far algorithms can go in speed for such simple problems. Let me know in the comments below, if you have any faster or alternate algorithms in mind.

There is no dearth of \" Installation \" guides of Arch on web. So why another one? With advancements like BTRFS file system, UEFI motherboards and modern in-development desktop environment like Plasma 5; traditional Arch Wiki guide and Arch Beginners' Guide can only be of a limited help. After I got my new desktop , my goal was to setup it with a modern setup. I decided to go with Arch Linux with btrfs file system and Plasma 5 desktop. Coming from OSX , I just love how far linux has come in terms of looks - far better than OSX ! I will cover this in two parts. First in this post, I will install the base system. Then, in a follow up post, I will discuss details of setting up final working Plasma 5 desktop. Initial Setup Download the latest iso from Arch website and create the uefi usb installation media. I used my mac to do this on terminal: $ diskutil list $ diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk1 $ dd if = image.iso of = /dev/rdisk1 bs = 1m 20480+0 records in 20480+0 records out 167772160 bytes transferred in 220.016918 secs ( 762542 bytes/sec ) $ diskutil eject /dev/disk1 Use this media to boot into your machine. You should boot into UEFI mode if you have a UEFI motherboard and UEFI mode enabled. To verify you have booted in UEFU mode, run: $ efivar -l This should give you a list of set UEFI variables. Please look at the Begineers' Guide in case you do not get any list of UEFI variables. Wifi To setup wifi simply run: $ wifi-menu This is a pretty straight forward tool and will setup wifi for you for this installation session. This will also create a file at /etc/netctl/ . We will use this file later to enable wifi at the first session after installation. For editing different configurations, I tend to use vim . So we will update our package cache and install vim. $ pacman -Syy $ pacman -S vim Hard Drives In my desktop, I have two hard drives, one 256 GB solid state drive ( SDD ) and another 1TB hard drive ( HDD ). I set up my drives as follows: - SDD for root(/), /boot, /opt and /home partitions - HDD for /var and /media partitions. For UEFI machines, we need to use a GPT partition table and /boot partition has to be a fat32 partition with a minimum size of 512 MB . We will format rest other partitions with BTRFS . See this link for benefits of using btrfs partitions. First list your hard drives with the following: $ lsblk $ cat /proc/partitions Assuming, my setup above, now create gpt partitions and format them. $ dd if = /dev/zero of = /dev/sda bs = 1M count = 5000 $ gdisk /dev/sda Found invalid MBR and corrupt GPT. What do you want to do ? ( Using the GPT MAY permit recovery of GPT data. ) 1 - Use current GPT 2 - Create blank GPT Then press 2 to create a blank GPT and start fresh ZAP: $ press x - to go to extended menu $ press z - to zap $ press Y - to confirm $ press Y - to delete MBR It might now kick us out of gdisk, so get back into it: $ gdisk /dev/sda $ Command ( ? for help ) : m $ Command ( ? for help ) : n $ Partition number ( 1-128, default 1 ) : $ First sector ( 34-500118158, default = 2048 ) or { +- } size { KMGTP } : $ Last sector ( 2048-500118, default = 500118 ) or { +- } size { KMGTP } : 512M $ Current type is 'Linux filesystem' $ Hex code or GUID ( L to show codes, Enter = 8300 ) : ef00 $ Changed type of partition to 'EFI System' $ Partition number ( 2-128, default 2 ) : $ First sector ( 34-500118, default = 16779264 ) or { +- } size { KMGTP } : $ Last sector ( 16779264-500118, default = 500118 ) or { +- } size { KMGTP } : $ Current type is 'Linux filesystem' $ Hex code or GUID ( L to show codes, Enter = 8300 ) : $ Changed type of partition to 'Linux filesystem' $ Command ( ? for help ) : p $ Press w to write to disk $ Press Y to confirm Repeat the above procedure for /dev/sdb , but create just one partition with all values as default. At the end we will have three partitions: /dev/sda1, /dev/sda2 and /dev/sdb1 Now we will format these partitions. $ mkfs.vfat -F32 /dev/sda1 $ mkfs.btrfs -L arch /dev/sda2 $ mkfs.btrfs -L data /dev/sdb1 Now, we will create btrfs subvolumes and mount them properly for installation and final setup. $ mount /dev/sda2 /mnt $ btrfs subvolume create /mnt/ROOT $ btrfs subvolume create /mnt/opt $ btrfs subvolume create /mnt/home $ umount /mnt $ mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt $ btrfs subvolume create /mnt/var $ btrfs subvolume create /mnt/media $ umount /mnt Now, once the subvolumes have been created, we will mount them in appropriate locations with optimal flags. $SSD_MOUNTS = \"rw,noatime,nodev,compress=lzo,ssd,discard,space_cache,aut odefrag,inode_cache\" $ HDD_MOUNTS = \"rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,space_cache\" $ EFI_MOUNTS = \"rw,noatime,discard,nodev,nosuid,noexec\" $ mount -o $SSD_MOUNTS ,subvol = ROOT /dev/sda2 /mnt $ mkdir -p /mnt/opt $ mkdir -p /mnt/home $ mkdir -p /mnt/var $ mkdir -p /mnt/media $ mount -o $SSD_MOUNTS ,nosuid,subvol = opt /dev/sda2 /mnt/opt $ mount -o $SSD_MOUNTS ,nosuid,subvol = home /dev/sda2 /mnt/home $ mount -o $HDD_MOUNTS ,subvol = var /dev/sdb1 /mnt/var $ mount -o $HDD_MOUNTS ,subvol = media /dev/sdb1 /mnt/media $ mkdir -p /mnt/boot $ mount -o $EFI_MOUNTS /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot Base Installation Now, we will do the actually installation of base packages. $ pacstrap /mnt base base-devel btrfs-progs $ genfstab -U -p /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab Edit the /mnt/ect/fstab file to add following /tmp mounts. tmpfs /tmp tmpfs rw,nodev,nosuid 0 0 tmpfs /dev/shm tmpfs rw,nodev,nosuid,noexec 0 0 Copy our current wifi setup file into the new system. This will enable wifi at first boot. Next, chroot into our newly installed system: $ cp /etc/netctl/wl* /mnt/etc/netctl/ $ arch-chroot /mnt /bin/bash Some basic setup: $ pacman -Syy $ pacman -S sudo vim $ vim /etc/locale.gen ... $en_SG ISO-8859-1 en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8 $en_US ISO-8859-1 ... $ locale-gen $ echo LANG = en_US.UTF-8 > /etc/locale.conf $ export LANG = en_US.UTF-8 $ ls -l /usr/share/zoneinfo $ ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Zone/SubZone /etc/localtime $ hwclock --systohc --utc $ sed -i \"s/# %wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL/%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL/\" /etc/sudoers $ HOSTNAME = euler $ echo $HOSTNAME > /etc/hostname $ pacman -S dosfstools efibootmgr $ sed -i 's/&#94;\\(HOOKS=.*fsck\\)\\(.*$\\)/\\1 btrfs\\2/g' /etc/mkinitcpio.conf $ mkinitcpio -p linux $ gummiboot install $ passwd We also need to install following packages for wifi to work at first boot: $ pacman -S iw wpa_supplicant We will also add hostname to our /etc/hosts file: $ vim /etc/hosts ... 127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost $HOSTNAME ::1 localhost.localdomain localhost $HOSTNAME ... We will do the final setup now, that should enable us to login into our newly installed system. Make sure following two files look as follows: $ vim /boot/loader/loader.conf ... timeout 3 default arch ... $ vim /boot/loader/entries/arch.conf ... title Arch Linux linux /vmlinuz-linux initrd /initramfs-linux.img options root = UUID = 1c27fa42-ca19-482f-b49a-3b8366eb7783 rw rootfstype = btrfs rootflags = subvol = ROOT ... $ exit $ umount -R /mnt $ reboot Awesome!

He wants to transport his 10000 apples to the market, which is located after the forest. The distance between his apple plantation and the market is about 1000 kilometer. So he decided to take his monkey to carry the apples. The monkey can carry at the maximum of 2000 apples at a time, and it eats one apple and throws another one for every kilometer it travels. What is the largest number of apples that can be delivered to the market? Please give your solutions in the comments below. Solution If the owner lets the monkey carry apples all the way to the end of the forest, in the first trip itself, all of 2000 aplles will be lost and the monkey will never return back, as the monkey will be out of any food and play. Lets approach this in a different way. Lets break the monkey's journey by per unit distance. To carry 10000 apples for 1 km, monkey has to make 2 x 5 - 1 = 9 trips! On each trip, the owner will loose 2 apples. Hence, for each km distance travelled untill number of apples is greater than 8000, monkey requires 9 x 2 = 18 apples. So, distance travelled by monkey until number of apples is less than 8000 is int(2000 / 18) + 1 = 112 km, and by this time, 10,000 - 112 x 18 = 7984 apples are left. Similarily, until 6000 apples are left, the monkey will require 2 x 4 - 1 = 7 trips for every km. Hence, the total distance travelled until no. of apples left is less than 6000 is 112 + int(2000 / 14) + 1 = 255 km, and by this time no. of apples left is 7984 - 143 x 14 = 5982. Now proceeding in a similar manner, until 4000 apples are left, the monkey will require 5 trips for each km. Total distance travelled until no. of apples left is less than 4000 is 255 + int(2000/10) = 455 km. By this time, number of apples left is 5982 - 200 x 10 = 3982. Until 2000 apples are left, the monkey will require 3 trips per km travelled. Total distance travelled till this time is 455 + int(2000/6) + 1 = 789 km. By this time, no. of apples left is 3982 - 334 x 6 = 1978. Below 2000 apples, the mokey will require only one trip to reach to market. Distance left is 1000 - 789 = 211 km. Number of apples required by the monkey to travel this distance is 211 x 2 = 422. Hence, total number of apples that can reach the market is just 1978 - 422 = 1556! That's just 15.56% of all apples. That's quite bad monkey. Moral of the story is, avoid dealing with fools :) Thank you all who tried this.

Problem Statement A man needs to go through a train tunnel to reach the other side. He starts running through the tunnel in an effort to reach his destination as soon as possible. When he is 1/4th of the way through the tunnel, he hears the train whistle behind him. Assuming the tunnel is not big enough for him and the train, he has to get out of the tunnel in order to survive. We know that the following conditions are true. If he runs back, he will make it out of the tunnel by a whisker. If he continues running forward, he will still make it out through the other end by a whisker. What is the speed of the train compared to that of the man? Please give your solutions in the comments below. Solution If the man decided to go back, he would have met the train at the entrance of tunnel (i.e The man would have travelled 0.25 of the tunnel). Instead, if man went forward- by the time train would have reached at the entrance of tunnel, the man would have been at the 0.25+0.25 = 0.5 of tunnel. Hence, according to the second condition, the time taken by man to travel half of tunnel is same as the time taken by the train to travel all of the tunnel. Therefore, the train is traveling at twice the speed of the man.
