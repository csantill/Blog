Vermicelli, or also known as Seviyan in Hindi, is commonly cooked as a sweet dish in Indian subcontinent. As I try to be away from all things sweet, I came across this recipe which uses this in a quite spicy flavor. So, here is my super quick and tasty recipe for these noodles. It takes less than 12 minutes ( 4 Minutes Preparation + 8 Minutes Cooking).

Overlapping occurrences are counted as distinct. If there are several candidates of the same length, you must output all of them in the order of occurrence. The \" space \" is NOT considered as a valid non-repeating substring. Example: Consider the following cases: Case 1: If the given string is asdfsasa , the answer should be ['d', 'f'] Case 2: If the given string is sadanands , the answer should be ['sa', 'ad', 'da', 'na', 'nd', 'ds'] Case 3: If the given string is wwwwwwww , the answer should be ['wwwwwwww'] My Solution Here is my solution in Python . It is quite brute force. I am not sure about the order of find() and rfind() built-in methods in Python. Assuming these are O(n) , my algorithm is in O(n 3 ) . Please put your answers in comments below, if your answer has a better scaling. The function definition that I use for finding non-empty non-repeating strings is recurcive. def findNsubString ( s , n ): subS = [] for index in range ( len ( s ) + 1 ) : x = s [ index : index + n ] if s . find ( x ) == s . rfind ( x ) : subS . append ( x ) if subS : return subS else : return findNsubString ( s , n + 1 ) I call this method as follows to get the desired results: #! /usr/bin/python import argparse # Parse Command Line Arguements parser = argparse . ArgumentParser () parser . add_argument ( \"-s\" , \"--string\" , default = \"asdfdfa\" , help = \"String Input\" ) args = parser . parse_args () s = args . string # Call Method to find smallest non-repeating sub-string ans = findNsubString ( s , 1 ) print ans A similar solution can also be written in JAVA or C++. The corresponding find() and rfind() methods in JAVA are called indexOf() and lastIndexOf() , respectively. In C++, these methods are called same as in Python.

As a kid, I always loved a vegetable made by my mom, which was made of red leaves, called \" Laal Saag \" in Hindi. I could never find what exactly was the English/American name for those leaves. Recently, at one of the Korean grocery stores, I came across red Amaranth leaves. Those looked strikingly similar to the red leaves that I used to have back home in India. So, here is my super fast and healthy recipe for these red leaves. It took me just 10 minutes ( 5 Minutes Preparation + 5 Minutes Cooking). Ingredients 1 Bunch Red Amaranth Leaves 1/2 tbsp Turmeric Powder 1 tbsp Coriander Powder 1 tbsp Garam Masala 1 tbsp Mustard Black Seeds 1 tbsp Cumin Seeds 2 tbsp Olive Oil Salt to taste Preparation Wash the leaves thoroughly in running water and chop them (about 1 inch cuts). Heat a deep pan on Medium for about 1 minute and then pour olive oil into it. After about 30 seconds, Add mustard seeds and cumin seeds after another 30 seconds. Once Seeds start to pop, add cut leaves into the pan. Add salt, close the lid and keep stirring occasionally. Once the leaves have lost water, add all the spices and keep frying until things are dry (about 2-3 minutes). You can serve this with any Indian bread, or with rice and lentils ( Daal ).

He wants to transport his 10000 apples to the market, which is located after the forest. The distance between his apple plantation and the market is about 1000 kilometer. So he decided to take his monkey to carry the apples. The monkey can carry at the maximum of 2000 apples at a time, and it eats one apple and throws another one for every kilometer it travels. What is the largest number of apples that can be delivered to the market? Please give your solutions in the comments below. Solution If the owner lets the monkey carry apples all the way to the end of the forest, in the first trip itself, all of 2000 aplles will be lost and the monkey will never return back, as the monkey will be out of any food and play. Lets approach this in a different way. Lets break the monkey's journey by per unit distance. To carry 10000 apples for 1 km, monkey has to make 2 x 5 - 1 = 9 trips! On each trip, the owner will loose 2 apples. Hence, for each km distance travelled untill number of apples is greater than 8000, monkey requires 9 x 2 = 18 apples. So, distance travelled by monkey until number of apples is less than 8000 is int(2000 / 18) + 1 = 112 km, and by this time, 10,000 - 112 x 18 = 7984 apples are left. Similarily, until 6000 apples are left, the monkey will require 2 x 4 - 1 = 7 trips for every km. Hence, the total distance travelled until no. of apples left is less than 6000 is 112 + int(2000 / 14) + 1 = 255 km, and by this time no. of apples left is 7984 - 143 x 14 = 5982. Now proceeding in a similar manner, until 4000 apples are left, the monkey will require 5 trips for each km. Total distance travelled until no. of apples left is less than 4000 is 255 + int(2000/10) = 455 km. By this time, number of apples left is 5982 - 200 x 10 = 3982. Until 2000 apples are left, the monkey will require 3 trips per km travelled. Total distance travelled till this time is 455 + int(2000/6) + 1 = 789 km. By this time, no. of apples left is 3982 - 334 x 6 = 1978. Below 2000 apples, the mokey will require only one trip to reach to market. Distance left is 1000 - 789 = 211 km. Number of apples required by the monkey to travel this distance is 211 x 2 = 422. Hence, total number of apples that can reach the market is just 1978 - 422 = 1556! That's just 15.56% of all apples. That's quite bad monkey. Moral of the story is, avoid dealing with fools :) Thank you all who tried this.

Problem Statement A man needs to go through a train tunnel to reach the other side. He starts running through the tunnel in an effort to reach his destination as soon as possible. When he is 1/4th of the way through the tunnel, he hears the train whistle behind him. Assuming the tunnel is not big enough for him and the train, he has to get out of the tunnel in order to survive. We know that the following conditions are true. If he runs back, he will make it out of the tunnel by a whisker. If he continues running forward, he will still make it out through the other end by a whisker. What is the speed of the train compared to that of the man? Please give your solutions in the comments below. Solution If the man decided to go back, he would have met the train at the entrance of tunnel (i.e The man would have travelled 0.25 of the tunnel). Instead, if man went forward- by the time train would have reached at the entrance of tunnel, the man would have been at the 0.25+0.25 = 0.5 of tunnel. Hence, according to the second condition, the time taken by man to travel half of tunnel is same as the time taken by the train to travel all of the tunnel. Therefore, the train is traveling at twice the speed of the man.
