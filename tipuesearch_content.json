No puzzles, no math, no computers and most important, no Food! And as usual blame is on my work schedule. But, never is too late. Especially, when you can start with some exotic food! Here is one of Abha's finest creations from her Kitchen. Carrot halwa is a common north Indian dessert, healthy carrots cooked in milk and mango puree. Ingredients 8-10 organic carrots (for a more authentic taste). Condensed milk (medium size) or 1-2 cup Ricotta cheese 1-2 cup whole Milk. Dried nuts (Chopped Almonds, Cashews, Golden raisins and Dates) Sugar/Fresh Mango puree as per taste. 3-4 Tablespoon unsalted butter 3-4 whole cardamom or 1/2 teaspoon cardamom powder Preparation Wash and Peel the carrots and grate them. Heat a non-stick pan on medium flame and add 3-4 tablespoon of butter. When the butter melts, add the grated carrots and start frying. Stir the carrots till all the water from the carrots is lost. Add Ricotta cheese with 1-2 cup whole milk or 1 can of Condensed milk and let the carrots cook for 5-7 minutes on low flame. Continuously stir the carrots so as not to burn them. When 3/4th of the milk is dried, add chopped nuts and Sugar. Turn off the flame after 3-4 minutes, after all the milk is dried. Let the halwa cool down. Garnish it with nuts and dried milk.

While going through some materials on algorithms, I have come across an interesting discussion -enhancements in hardware (cpu) vis-a-vis algorithms. One side of the coin is the hardware - the speed of computers.The famous Moore's law states that: The complexity for minimum component costs has increased at a rate of roughly a factor of two per year . Certainly over the short term this rate can be expected to continue, if not to increase. Over the longer term, the rate of increase is a bit more uncertain, although there is no reason to believe it will not remain nearly constant for at least 10 years. — G. Moore, 1965 In simple words, Moore's law is the observation that, over the history of computing hardware, the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit has doubled approximately every two years. More precisely, the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit has increased by a factor of 1.6 every two years. More recently, keeping up with this has been challenging. In the context of this discussion, the inherent assumption is that number of transistors is directly proportional to the speed of computers. Now, looking at the other side of the coin - speed of algorithms. According to Excerpt from Report to the President and Congress: Designing a Digital Future, December 2010 (page 97) : Everyone knows Moore's Law – a prediction made in 1965 by Intel co-­founder Gordon Moore that the density of transistors in integrated circuits would continue to double every 1 to 2 years…. in many areas, performance gains due to improvements in algorithms have vastly exceeded even the dramatic performance gains due to increased processor speed. The gain in computing speed due to algorithms have been simply phenomenal, unprecedented, to say the least! Being actively involved with realization of Moore's law ( guess where I work! ), I have been naturally attracted in the study and design of algorithms. To get a more practical perspective on this, lets look at the problem of finding large Fibonacci numbers . These numbers have been used in wide areas ranging from arts to economics to biology to computer science to the game of poker! The simple definition of these numbers are: $$F_{n} = \\begin{cases} F_{n-2} + F_{n-1} & \\text{if } n > 1 \\\\ 1 & \\text{if } n = 1 \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } n = 0 \\end{cases}$$ So, first few Fibonacci numbers are: \\(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144 \\ldots\\) These numbers grow almost as fast as powers of 2: for example, \\(F_{30}\\) is over a million, and \\(F_{100}\\) is 21 digits long! In general, \\(F_n \\approx 2&#94;{0.694n}\\) Clearly, we need a computing device to calculate say \\(F_{200}\\) . The most basic algorithm, that comes to mind is a recursive scheme that taps directly into the above definition of Fibonacci series. def fibRecursive ( n ): if n == 0 : return 0 if n == 1 : return 1 return fibRecursive ( n - 2 ) + fibRecursive ( n - 1 ) If you analyze this scheme, this is in fact an exponential algorithm, i.e. fibRecursive( n ) is proportional to \\(2&#94;{0.694n} \\approx (1.6)&#94;n\\) , so it takes 1.6 times longer to compute \\(F_{n+1}\\) than \\(F_n\\) . This is interesting. Recall, under Moore's law, computers get roughly 1.6 times faster every 2 years. So if we can reasonably compute \\(F_{100}\\) with this year's technology, then only after 2 years we will manage to get \\(F_{101}\\) ! Only one more Fibonacci number every 2 years! Luckily, algorithms have grown at a much faster pace. Let's consider improvements w.r.t to this current problem of finding \\(n&#94;{th}\\) Fibonacci number, \\(F_n\\) . First problem we should realize in the above recursive scheme is that we are recalculating lower \\(F_n\\) at each recursion level. Lets solve this issue by storing each calculation and avoiding any re-calculation! def fibN2 ( n ): a = 0 b = 1 if n == 0 : return 0 for i in range ( 1 , n + 1 ): c = a + b a = b b = c return b On first glance this looks like an \\(\\mathcal{O}(n)\\) scheme, as we consider each addition as one operation. However, we should realize that as \\(n\\) increases, addition can not be assumed as a single operation, rather every step of addition is an \\(\\mathcal{O}(n)\\) operation, recall first grade Math for adding numbers digit by digit!! Hence, this algorithm is an \\(\\mathcal{O}(n&#94;2)\\) scheme. Can we do better? You bet, we can! Lets consider the following scheme: $$\\begin{pmatrix} 1&1 \\\\ 1&0 \\end{pmatrix}&#94;n = \\begin{pmatrix} F_{n+1}&F_n \\\\ F_n&F_{n-1} \\end{pmatrix}$$ We can use a recursive scheme to calculate this matrix power using a divide and conquer scheme in \\(\\mathcal{O}(\\log{}n)\\) time. def mul ( A , B ): a , b , c = A d , e , f = B return a * d + b * e , a * e + b * f , b * e + c * f def pow ( A , n ): if n == 1 : return A if n & 1 == 0 : return pow ( mul ( A , A ), n // 2 ) else : return mul ( A , pow ( mul ( A , A ), ( n - 1 ) // 2 )) def fibLogN ( n ): if n < 2 : return n return pow (( 1 , 1 , 0 ), n - 1 )[ 0 ] Lets think a bit harder about this. Is it really an \\(\\mathcal{O}(\\log{}n)\\) scheme? It involves multiplication of numbers, the method mul(A, B). What happens when \\(n\\) is very large? Sure, this will blow up, as typical multiplication would be an \\(\\mathcal{O}(n&#94;2)\\) operation. So, in fact, our new scheme is \\(\\mathcal{O}(n&#94;2 \\log{}n)\\) ! Luckily, we can solve even large multiplications in \\(\\mathcal{O}(n&#94;{log_2{3}} \\approx n&#94;{1.585})\\) , using Karatsuba multiplication , which is again a divide and conquer scheme. Here is one simple implementation (Same as the above scheme, but with the following mul(A,B) method): _CUTOFF = 1536 def mul ( A , B ): a , b , c = A d , e , f = B return multiply ( a , d ) + multiply ( b , e ), multiply ( a , e ) + multiply ( b , f ), multiply ( b , e ) + multiply ( c , f ) def multiply ( x , y ): if x . bit_length () <= _CUTOFF or y . bit_length () <= _CUTOFF : return x * y else : n = max ( x . bit_length (), y . bit_length ()) half = ( n + 32 ) // 64 * 32 mask = ( 1 << half ) - 1 xlow = x & mask ylow = y & mask xhigh = x >> half yhigh = y >> half a = multiply ( xhigh , yhigh ) b = multiply ( xlow + xhigh , ylow + yhigh ) c = multiply ( xlow , ylow ) d = b - a - c return ((( a << half ) + d ) << half ) + c So, this final scheme is in \\(\\mathcal{O}(n&#94;{1.585}\\log{}n)\\) time. Here is one final way of solving this problem in the same \\(\\mathcal{O}(n&#94;{1.585}\\log{}n)\\) time, but using a somewhat simpler scheme! If we know \\(F_K\\) and \\(F_{K+1}\\) , then we can find, $$F_{2K} = F_K \\left [ 2F_{K+1}-F_K \\right ]$$ $$F_{2K+1} = {F_{K+1}}&#94;2+{F_K}&#94;2$$ We can implement this using the Karatsuba multiplication as follows: def fibFast ( n ): if n <= 2 : return 1 k = n // 2 a = fibFast ( k + 1 ) b = fibFast ( k ) if n % 2 == 1 : return multiply ( a , a ) + multiply ( b , b ) else : return multiply ( b ,( 2 * a - b )) That's it for today. We saw how far algorithms can go in speed for such simple problems. Let me know in the comments below, if you have any faster or alternate algorithms in mind.

This is a simple one - do not go by the technicality of the problem statement. Solution \\(p&#94;2-1 = (p-1)\\times (p+1)\\) Given, \\(p\\) is a prime number \\(>3\\) , \\(p-1\\) and \\(p+1\\) are even. We can also write, $$p-1 = 2K, \\mbox{ and } p+1 = 2K+2 = 2(K+1)$$ Given, \\(K \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) , either \\(K\\) or \\(K+1\\) are also even. Hence, \\((p-1)\\times (p+1)\\) is divisible by \\(2\\times 4 = 8\\) . Furthermore, as \\(p\\) is prime, we can write it as either \\(p = 3s+1\\) or \\(p = 3s-1\\) , where \\(s \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) . In either case, one of \\(p-1\\) or \\(p+1\\) are divisible by 3 as well. Hence, \\(p&#94;2-1\\) is divisible by \\(8\\times 3 = 24\\) . Puzzle 2: Hopping on a Chess Board On a chess board, basically a \\(8\\times 8\\) grid, how many ways one can go from the left most bottom corner to the right most upper corner? In chess naming conventions, from \"a1\" to \"h8\". Clarification: In the original post this problem was ill defined. Please solve this problem with the constraints that only up and right moves are allowed. Can you find the generic answer for the case of \\(N\\times M\\) grid. Solution Correction: For an \\(N\\times M\\) grid, we need only \\(N-1\\) right and \\(M-1\\) up moves. Thank you Devin for pointing this out. Given only forward moves are allowed, for any arbitrary grid of \\(N\\times M\\) , a total of \\((N-1) + (M-1)\\) moves are needed. Any \\(N-1\\) of these moves can be of type right and \\(M-1\\) of type up . In short, this is a combinatorial problem of distributing \\(N+M-2\\) objects into groups of \\(N-1\\) and \\(M-1\\) . This is simply, $$\\dbinom{N+M-2}{N-1} = \\frac{(N+M-2)!}{(N-1)! (M-1)!}$$ In the particular case of the chess board, \\(N = M = 8\\) . Hence, total number of possible paths are: $$ \\mbox{No. of Paths} = \\frac{14!}{7! 7!} =3432$$ Thank you Rohit and Amber for posting quick solutions!

There is no dearth of \" Installation \" guides of Arch on web. So why another one? With advancements like BTRFS file system, UEFI motherboards and modern in-development desktop environment like Plasma 5; traditional Arch Wiki guide and Arch Beginners' Guide can only be of a limited help. After I got my new desktop , my goal was to setup it with a modern setup. I decided to go with Arch Linux with btrfs file system and Plasma 5 desktop. Coming from OSX , I just love how far linux has come in terms of looks - far better than OSX ! I will cover this in two parts. First in this post, I will install the base system. Then, in a follow up post, I will discuss details of setting up final working Plasma 5 desktop. Initial Setup Download the latest iso from Arch website and create the uefi usb installation media. I used my mac to do this on terminal: $ diskutil list $ diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk1 $ dd if = image.iso of = /dev/rdisk1 bs = 1m 20480+0 records in 20480+0 records out 167772160 bytes transferred in 220.016918 secs ( 762542 bytes/sec ) $ diskutil eject /dev/disk1 Use this media to boot into your machine. You should boot into UEFI mode if you have a UEFI motherboard and UEFI mode enabled. To verify you have booted in UEFU mode, run: $ efivar -l This should give you a list of set UEFI variables. Please look at the Begineers' Guide in case you do not get any list of UEFI variables. Wifi To setup wifi simply run: $ wifi-menu This is a pretty straight forward tool and will setup wifi for you for this installation session. This will also create a file at /etc/netctl/ . We will use this file later to enable wifi at the first session after installation. For editing different configurations, I tend to use vim . So we will update our package cache and install vim. $ pacman -Syy $ pacman -S vim Hard Drives In my desktop, I have two hard drives, one 256 GB solid state drive ( SDD ) and another 1TB hard drive ( HDD ). I set up my drives as follows: - SDD for root(/), /boot, /opt and /home partitions - HDD for /var and /media partitions. For UEFI machines, we need to use a GPT partition table and /boot partition has to be a fat32 partition with a minimum size of 512 MB . We will format rest other partitions with BTRFS . See this link for benefits of using btrfs partitions. First list your hard drives with the following: $ lsblk $ cat /proc/partitions Assuming, my setup above, now create gpt partitions and format them. $ dd if = /dev/zero of = /dev/sda bs = 1M count = 5000 $ gdisk /dev/sda Found invalid MBR and corrupt GPT. What do you want to do ? ( Using the GPT MAY permit recovery of GPT data. ) 1 - Use current GPT 2 - Create blank GPT Then press 2 to create a blank GPT and start fresh ZAP: $ press x - to go to extended menu $ press z - to zap $ press Y - to confirm $ press Y - to delete MBR It might now kick us out of gdisk, so get back into it: $ gdisk /dev/sda $ Command ( ? for help ) : m $ Command ( ? for help ) : n $ Partition number ( 1-128, default 1 ) : $ First sector ( 34-500118158, default = 2048 ) or { +- } size { KMGTP } : $ Last sector ( 2048-500118, default = 500118 ) or { +- } size { KMGTP } : 512M $ Current type is 'Linux filesystem' $ Hex code or GUID ( L to show codes, Enter = 8300 ) : ef00 $ Changed type of partition to 'EFI System' $ Partition number ( 2-128, default 2 ) : $ First sector ( 34-500118, default = 16779264 ) or { +- } size { KMGTP } : $ Last sector ( 16779264-500118, default = 500118 ) or { +- } size { KMGTP } : $ Current type is 'Linux filesystem' $ Hex code or GUID ( L to show codes, Enter = 8300 ) : $ Changed type of partition to 'Linux filesystem' $ Command ( ? for help ) : p $ Press w to write to disk $ Press Y to confirm Repeat the above procedure for /dev/sdb , but create just one partition with all values as default. At the end we will have three partitions: /dev/sda1, /dev/sda2 and /dev/sdb1 Now we will format these partitions. $ mkfs.vfat -F32 /dev/sda1 $ mkfs.btrfs -L arch /dev/sda2 $ mkfs.btrfs -L data /dev/sdb1 Now, we will create btrfs subvolumes and mount them properly for installation and final setup. $ mount /dev/sda2 /mnt $ btrfs subvolume create /mnt/ROOT $ btrfs subvolume create /mnt/opt $ btrfs subvolume create /mnt/home $ umount /mnt $ mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt $ btrfs subvolume create /mnt/var $ btrfs subvolume create /mnt/media $ umount /mnt Now, once the subvolumes have been created, we will mount them in appropriate locations with optimal flags. $SSD_MOUNTS = \"rw,noatime,nodev,compress=lzo,ssd,discard,space_cache,aut odefrag,inode_cache\" $ HDD_MOUNTS = \"rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,space_cache\" $ EFI_MOUNTS = \"rw,noatime,discard,nodev,nosuid,noexec\" $ mount -o $SSD_MOUNTS ,subvol = ROOT /dev/sda2 /mnt $ mkdir -p /mnt/opt $ mkdir -p /mnt/home $ mkdir -p /mnt/var $ mkdir -p /mnt/media $ mount -o $SSD_MOUNTS ,nosuid,subvol = opt /dev/sda2 /mnt/opt $ mount -o $SSD_MOUNTS ,nosuid,subvol = home /dev/sda2 /mnt/home $ mount -o $HDD_MOUNTS ,subvol = var /dev/sdb1 /mnt/var $ mount -o $HDD_MOUNTS ,subvol = media /dev/sdb1 /mnt/media $ mkdir -p /mnt/boot $ mount -o $EFI_MOUNTS /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot Base Installation Now, we will do the actually installation of base packages. $ pacstrap /mnt base base-devel btrfs-progs $ genfstab -U -p /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab Edit the /mnt/ect/fstab file to add following /tmp mounts. tmpfs /tmp tmpfs rw,nodev,nosuid 0 0 tmpfs /dev/shm tmpfs rw,nodev,nosuid,noexec 0 0 Copy our current wifi setup file into the new system.

Overlapping occurrences are counted as distinct. If there are several candidates of the same length, you must output all of them in the order of occurrence. The \" space \" is NOT considered as a valid non-repeating substring. Example: Consider the following cases: Case 1: If the given string is asdfsasa , the answer should be ['d', 'f'] Case 2: If the given string is sadanands , the answer should be ['sa', 'ad', 'da', 'na', 'nd', 'ds'] Case 3: If the given string is wwwwwwww , the answer should be ['wwwwwwww'] My Solution Here is my solution in Python . It is quite brute force. I am not sure about the order of find() and rfind() built-in methods in Python. Assuming these are O(n) , my algorithm is in O(n 3 ) . Please put your answers in comments below, if your answer has a better scaling.

He wants to transport his 10000 apples to the market, which is located after the forest. The distance between his apple plantation and the market is about 1000 kilometer. So he decided to take his monkey to carry the apples. The monkey can carry at the maximum of 2000 apples at a time, and it eats one apple and throws another one for every kilometer it travels. What is the largest number of apples that can be delivered to the market? Please give your solutions in the comments below. Solution If the owner lets the monkey carry apples all the way to the end of the forest, in the first trip itself, all of 2000 aplles will be lost and the monkey will never return back, as the monkey will be out of any food and play. Lets approach this in a different way. Lets break the monkey's journey by per unit distance. To carry 10000 apples for 1 km, monkey has to make 2 x 5 - 1 = 9 trips! On each trip, the owner will loose 2 apples. Hence, for each km distance travelled untill number of apples is greater than 8000, monkey requires 9 x 2 = 18 apples. So, distance travelled by monkey until number of apples is less than 8000 is int(2000 / 18) + 1 = 112 km, and by this time, 10,000 - 112 x 18 = 7984 apples are left. Similarily, until 6000 apples are left, the monkey will require 2 x 4 - 1 = 7 trips for every km. Hence, the total distance travelled until no. of apples left is less than 6000 is 112 + int(2000 / 14) + 1 = 255 km, and by this time no. of apples left is 7984 - 143 x 14 = 5982. Now proceeding in a similar manner, until 4000 apples are left, the monkey will require 5 trips for each km. Total distance travelled until no. of apples left is less than 4000 is 255 + int(2000/10) = 455 km. By this time, number of apples left is 5982 - 200 x 10 = 3982. Until 2000 apples are left, the monkey will require 3 trips per km travelled. Total distance travelled till this time is 455 + int(2000/6) + 1 = 789 km. By this time, no. of apples left is 3982 - 334 x 6 = 1978. Below 2000 apples, the mokey will require only one trip to reach to market. Distance left is 1000 - 789 = 211 km. Number of apples required by the monkey to travel this distance is 211 x 2 = 422. Hence, total number of apples that can reach the market is just 1978 - 422 = 1556! That's just 15.56% of all apples. That's quite bad monkey. Moral of the story is, avoid dealing with fools :) Thank you all who tried this.

Problem Statement A man needs to go through a train tunnel to reach the other side. He starts running through the tunnel in an effort to reach his destination as soon as possible. When he is 1/4th of the way through the tunnel, he hears the train whistle behind him. Assuming the tunnel is not big enough for him and the train, he has to get out of the tunnel in order to survive. We know that the following conditions are true. If he runs back, he will make it out of the tunnel by a whisker. If he continues running forward, he will still make it out through the other end by a whisker. What is the speed of the train compared to that of the man? Please give your solutions in the comments below. Solution If the man decided to go back, he would have met the train at the entrance of tunnel (i.e The man would have travelled 0.25 of the tunnel). Instead, if man went forward- by the time train would have reached at the entrance of tunnel, the man would have been at the 0.25+0.25 = 0.5 of tunnel. Hence, according to the second condition, the time taken by man to travel half of tunnel is same as the time taken by the train to travel all of the tunnel. Therefore, the train is traveling at twice the speed of the man.
