A deep learning model in [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) to
analyze important features and predict secondary structures of
[amyloid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid) proteins. Please look
at some of my past
[publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rSMYeYEAAAAJ&hl=en)
for additional details of this work.

{{% panel info "**Flac To mp3 Converter**" %}}

A simple python script to maintain `flac` and `mp3` files in sync, including
tags, and album art. This script can be used as a `cron` job to keep files
in sync. The code
[repository](https://github.com/sadanand-singh/flac2mp3) is available on
Github.
