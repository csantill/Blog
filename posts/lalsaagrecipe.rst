I have started eating a lot of greens these days. As a kid, I always
loved a vegetable made by my mom, which was made of red leaves, called
"*Laal Saag*" in Hindi. I could never find what exactly was the
English/American name for those leaves.

Recently, at one of the Korean grocery stores, I came across red
Amaranth leaves. Those looked strikingly similar to the red leaves that
I used to have back home in India.

So, here is my super fast and healthy recipe for these red leaves. It
took me just 10 minutes ( 5 Minutes Preparation + 5 Minutes Cooking).
