One of the first tasks involved in any data science project is to get to
understand the data. This can be extremely beneficial for several
reasons:

-  Catch mistakes in data
-  See patterns in data
-  Find violations of statistical assumptions
-  Generate hypotheses etc.

We can think of this task as an exercise in **summarization** of the
data. To summarize the main characteristics of the data, often two methods are used: numerical and graphical.

The numerical summary of data is done through |desStats|_.
While the graphical summary of the data is done through |EDA|_. In this
post, we will look at both of these fundamental
data science techniques in more detail using some examples.

Descriptive Statistics
=======================

Descriptive statistics are statistics that quantitatively describe or summarize
features of a collection of information. Some measures that are commonly used to
describe a data set are:

-  Central Tendency Measures or Measure of Location, such as *mean*
-  Measures of Variability or Dispersion, such as *standard deviation*
-  Measure of the shape of the distribution, such as *skewness* or *kurtosis*
-  Relative Standing Measures, such as *correlation coefficient*

Central Tendency Measures
