This is for all the lazy souls like me - in a mood to eat something
tasty, but in no mood to cook for long.

Vermicelli, or also known as *seviyan* in Hindi, is commonly cooked as a
sweet dish in Indian subcontinent. As I try to be away from all things
sweet, I came across this recipe which uses this in a quite spicy
flavor.

   Raw Materials

~~~~~~~~~~~

-  300 g Vermicelli *Seviyan*
-  1 cup Peas
-  1/2 Medium Onion
-  1 Medium Tomato
-  1 Clove of Garlic
-  4 Curry Leaves
-  1/2 tbsp Turmeric Powder
-  1 tbsp Coriander Powder
-  1 tbsp Mustard Black Seeds
-  1 tbsp Cumin Seeds
-  2 tbsp Olive Oil
-  Salt to taste
-  1/2 cup Peanuts *optional*

Preparation
~~~~~~~~~~~

1.  Wash the leaves thoroughly in running water and chop them (about 1
    inch cuts).
2.  Heat a deep pan on Medium for about 1 minute and then pour olive oil
    into it.
3.  After about 30 seconds, Add mustard seeds and cumin seeds after
    another 30 seconds.
4.  Once Seeds start to pop, add garlic and cut onions.
5.  Fry the onions until oil starts to separate (about 1-2 minutes)
6.  Add spices, curry leaves, peas and tomatoes.
7.  After about a minute, add noodles.
8.  After another minute or so, add salt, and keep stirring
    occasionally.
9.  Once the noodles have become light golden brown in color, add 1/2
    cup of water (about 2-3 minutes).
10. Keep stirring, so that noodles do not stick with each other, for
    about another 2 minutes

Let it cool before serving. You can use some ketchup or sauce with it. I
like adding peanuts to it while frying onions.
