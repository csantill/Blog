One of the first tasks involved in any data science project is to get to
understand the data. This can be extremely beneficial for several
reasons:

-   Catch mistakes in data
-   See patterns in data
-   Find violations of statistical assumptions
-   Generate hypotheses etc.

We can think of this task as an exercise in **summarization** of the
data. To summarize the main characteristics of the data, often two
methods are used: numerical and graphical.

The numerical summary of data is done through [*descriptive
statistics*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_statistics). While the graphical summary of the data is done through
[*exploratory data analysis (EDA)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis). In this post, we will look at both
of these fundamental data science techniques in more detail using some
examples.

Descriptive Statistics
======================

Descriptive statistics are statistics that quantitatively describe or
summarize features of a collection of information. Some measures that
are commonly used to describe a data set are:

-  Central Tendency Measures or Measure of Location, such as *mean*
-  Measures of Variability or Dispersion, such as *standard deviation*
-  Measure of the shape of the distribution, such as *skewness* or
   *kurtosis*
-  Relative Standing Measures, such as *correlation coefficient*
