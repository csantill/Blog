Last month or so has been all silent here. No puzzles, no math, no
computers and most important, no Food! And as usual blame is on my work
schedule.

Yes, the silence is finally over, and what's better than giving your
taste buds some rejuvenation after some long busy weeks at work.
Continuing with my healthy but tasty choices, today I tried to cook
*Palak* (Spinach) with *Paneer*.
